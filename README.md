## About Me
Hi, 

I am a creative technologist and programming enthusiast passionate about building tools, languages, and beautiful digital experiences. Iâ€™ve previously worked on projects ranging from custom math libraries for Roblox (like Theorist) to polished UI libraries (Gel), always with an eye for performance, structure, and a bit of flair.

Some of my favorite shows and television series include things like Only Murders in the Building, Love in The Afternoon, and other romance movies like Wuthering Heights, etc... When I am not coding, I am a student and I love mathematics the most, as it is a very interesting topic. In terms of coding, a love type systems and type theory. I also enjoy Idris2's dependent type system; it is a genius idea.

I may say I know JavaScript and TypeScript, but I ONLY do frontend work in those languages, as that is what I enjoy, not making APIs or servers. I might find the time to learn it later, but for now I am focusing on different things.
